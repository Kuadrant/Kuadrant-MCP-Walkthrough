## Body Base Routing (BBR) from Gateway API Inference Extension

## Overview

This repository serves as an experimentation environment for testing **[body-based routing](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension/tree/main/pkg/bbr)** using Envoy proxy with custom filters. The primary goals are:

1. **Test JSON-RPC body parsing and routing** - Route requests based on the `method` field in JSON-RPC request bodies
2. **Validate execution order** - Understand the sequence of filter processing phases (headers, body, etc.)
3. **Debug filter interactions** - Observe how ext-proc and WASM filters work together



### Run Env

```sh
make up
```

#### Run Traffic

```sh
./test-execution-order.sh
```

Check the output of the script, and the logs from the running containers.
You should see something like this:
